# Roman Numeral Converter

This is an algorithm designed to convert **standard digits** in base 10 to Roman Numerals. An important distinction is that numerals are ***not*** numbers, but representations of numbers. With that logic, the digits we use today are just Hindu-Arabic numerals... *which they are!* Numbers are simply a ***mathematical object*** used to count, measure, and label, albeit with different symbols in history and around the world.

## My Implementation

Presently, this simple converter abides *classical* rules, meaning numbers 1-3999 and no negative numbers."Modern" Roman numeral notation uses overlines indicating a multiplication by 1000. This expands the number range from 1 to 3,999,999. 

## Want to try it out?
Here are three ways to run my program, in order of complexity:

1) Use my website! [Click here](https://www.DeveloperSean.com) to see what it's all about!

2) Use an online JavaScript compiler.
    - Copy and paste my code into [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/javascript/online-compiler/) and give it the beans!

3) Download the project yourself and build upon it!

### Option 3: Advanced Users Only
Want to take a deeper dive into the Matrix? Here's how you can get set up with customizing 
this program and see what sort of mistakes you can make (it's all apart of the process!)  

**You'll Need:**

* [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (*An environment to write your own programs! It's free!*)

* [**Node.JS**](https://nodejs.org/en) (*So you can execute JavaScript code on your machine, rather than through a web browser! Also free!*)

After installing the above programs, make a new folder in any directory for this project.  

Download *main.js* into the new project folder, and open the file in VS Code.  

In VS, open the integrated terminal with Ctrl+`, or open through the 'View' tab. **Alternatively, you can open your local command line (CMD on Windows).**  
- *In EITHER terminal, be sure you are working in the directory of 'main.js'*  

Entering the following command will run the program. Huzzah!

```
node main.js
```

Thanks for reading, and good luck out there!
